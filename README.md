👋 Hi, I’m @aziztarous, and I strive to be a good full-stack developer.
👀 I’m interested in web development, mobile app development, and cloud computing.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular for front-end development, and diving deeper into back-end technologies like Node.js and Python with Flask.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that have a positive impact and contribute to the tech community.
📫 You can reach me through email at aziz.tarous@email.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at linkedin.com/in/aziztarous.
